# pair_weighting_loss

TensorFlow implementation of 'Language Person Search with Pair-based Weighting Loss' accepted by MMM2021

We implement our proposed method by modifying the train_models.py file in  **[Deep Cross-Modal Pojection Learning for Image-Text Matching](https://github.com/YingZhangDUT/Cross-Modal-Projection-Learning)**

To reproduce our proposed method, you should first replace the original train_models.py file with our modified one and then follow the instructions in the repository
